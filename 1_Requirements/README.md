### Introduction
The "electrical tariff" is the amount of money set by the supplier for the supply of electrical energy to various sorts of customers. In addition to fair costs, the tariff covers the complete cost of producing and supplying electrical energy. The exact tariff that the consumer pays is determined by the amount of electricity consumed. Industrial customers pay a higher rate than domestic customers since they use more power for longer periods of time. The cost of electricity is determined by the following factors: 1) The load type, The time when a load is required, The amount of energy that has been consumed. The fixed charge, rate of charge, costumer charge, electrical duty, and number of units utilised are all included in the total bill of the consumer.

## Advanatges
- We don't need to install metering equipment, thus there's a lower initial cost.
- The flat tariff will benefit the poor.
- Simple to comprehend
- Profitability that is reasonable
- Return in a proper manner

## Disadvanatges
Regardless of load variance, every client must pay set charges.


-  SWOT Analysis :

## 4W's and 1'H


## WHO
Consumers of different types will consume the electricity.

## WHEN

It can be used everytime and world is nothing without electrical power.

## WHERE
It is used all over the world.

## HOW
From conventional energy sources the energy is converted into useful form of electrical energy and it is generated, transmitted and distributed to consumers. And hence along with the units multiplied with rate of charge,the maintenance nothing but fixed and consumer charges are also added.


### Low level requirements:
1) Select the group
2) If its not belong to the enetrd group it will directly switch to other group.
3) After the selected The rate of charge belongs to that particular group will be multiplied with no. of units to get energy charges
